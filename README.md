You might remember the old [nsanamegenerator.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20160318190656/http://www.nsanamegenerator.com/). 
In homage to that page I created this one. 

By using the data of [Open English WordNet](https://en-word.net/) (you can also find them on [Github](https://github.com/globalwordnet/english-wordnet)) I created this random word generator.

If you prefer the OG version that combined two nouns, in all caps and witout any space to seperate, visit [alexcherrypi.github.io/nsanamegenerator/og/](https://alexcherrypi.github.io/nsanamegenerator/og/).
Otherwise there currently is only this version, aka the main version [alexcherrypi.github.io/nsanamegenerator/](https://alexcherrypi.github.io/nsanamegenerator/).

This is just a little side project of mine, so don't expect regular updates and a lot of ongoing development.

But if you want to suggest any features or ideas, submit them by creating an issue. I don't have any templates set up yet (and maybe never will), but don't be scared by thaat. Just write your idea down and submit the issue. :-)
